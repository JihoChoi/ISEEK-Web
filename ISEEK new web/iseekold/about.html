  <p class="plaintextcontainer">ISEEK will achieve its stated goals by partnering with governments, universities, NGOs, and corporations and creating a massively scalable infrastructure that will enable composition and delivery of comprehensive, contextually and culturally relevant games and other contents over mobile platforms. ISEEK’s mobile gaming and knowledge platform is specifically designed for peer-reviewed, crowd sourced content creation that could reach and support those with the least access to education and opportunity. </p>



<ul><h3>More specifically, ISEEK’s objectives are to:</h3>

<li>Facilitate the creation of a total ecosystem by bringing diverse set of resources such as platform, knowledge, capital,     talent, and access to markets</li>

<li>Employ innovative game-based technologies appropriate to people with limited or no literacy</li>

<li>Through Enactus projects, develop curricula and programs that appeal to and engage people with little or no education and steer them towards entrepreneurship in order to attain self reliance</li>

<li>Develop life skill content, including literacy, health and hygiene for the local communities</li> 

<li>Develop and publish an open source gaming platform that will enable our global partners to configure and customize learning modules into curricula to meet the needs of the local population.</li>
</ul>

  <p>Project Saksham (<em>empowered</em> in Hindi) is the first international project undertaken by ISEEK.  The project is based in the state of Jharkhand in India, where a large segment of the population lives below the subsistence level. Project Saksham will serve as a brand and a channel through which those associated with ISEEK will be able to sell and market the products they make - supporting their craft and providing them with continual business.</p></div>

  <h2>DEVELOPING AND GUIDING A GENERATION</h2>
  
 
  <p>Millions are kept from their potential due to lack of resources and social obstacles.
The majority of those kept from achievement have the skills and resilience to be successful.
ISEEK aims to help the world population achieve their potential and live their dreams.</p>

    <h4>OPENING CHANNELS FOR SUCCESS</h4>
    <p>ISEEK focuses on inclusive growth to help women gain access to a total ecosystem: business knowledge, micro-financing, and an avenue through which they can sell their products. By providing access to critical resources, Project Saksham will enable the women to profit from the talent, intuition, and ambition they already possess.

      <h4>HELPING WOMEN PROFIT FROM THEIR SKILLS</h4>
      <p>We have begun working with illiterate women in Jharkhand, India from age 16 to 19 - none formally educated beyond 4th grade. In Jharkand, a multitude of products are made by skilled women using their local resource, Tasar silk.</p>
