                    <p class="text-muted">Small group collective entrepreneurship is a concept to ensure Project Saksham’s success and scalability. A savings and loan community of 10-12 people learns integral skills and eventually becomes an entrepreneurial unit. More individuals are empowered with knowl∂çedge, thereby allowing for a division of labor, role definition, and self-policing within the group. Collective entrepreneurship helps to mobilize financial, human, knowledge, and physical capital to organize resources (social and conventional) to help create social enterprises, which then deliver social returns. This includes knowledge sharing which helps individual who alone will not be able to succeed.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">ISEEK helps to develop entrepreneurship curricula and programs that appeal to and engage people with education levels ranging from highly educated to little or no education. ISEEK plans to employ innovative game-based technologies appropriate to people with limited or no literacy. ISEEK will develop and publish an open-source gaming platform that will enable our global partners to easily configure and customize learning modules into curricula to meet the needs of the local population. This will help us to build an ecosystem by bringing a diverse set of resources such as knowledge, capital, talent, and access to market with risk mitigation.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">The Mentor Investor model is a crowd-funding mechanism through which anyone in the world can invest in a Saksham business through the Daksh platform, in tranches of $1000, in exchange for a stake in the company. Through online monitoring and advising, the Mentor Investors then guide the business to ensure its success. Mentor Investing disrupts the status quo in two ways: 1) the investor is also an active advisor in the enterprise, laying the groundwork for a robust, well-rounded business; and 2) the Daksh e-commerce platform allows for full information transparency between the small businesses and their respective investors. In the Mentor Investing Model, anyone worldwide who is interested in the mission of Saksham can invest in any potential SLC seeking to transition into a business. Once the investment is made and the Mentor Investor has a stake in the company, (s)he has the opportunity to play a dynamic role in building its operational capacity as it becomes a formal enterprise and grows. It is in the Mentor Investor’s interest that the business succeeds, so (s)he contributes to this success with expertise and knowledge throughout.</p>
                    <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="img/mentor investing.PNG">
                    <p class="text-muted">A potential Mentor Investor can access the Daksh database to view the information on all Saksham SLCs who are progressing through the Learning phase. The Mentor Investor has access to key information about the SLCs such as product, region of operation, progress in the Saksham business and health learning modules, and existing capital, so that he or she can make an educated investment decision. Mentor Investors can choose to make either an investment or a “pledge”, in which case the investment will not take effect until the SLC has completed particular learning modules within a certain timeframe.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">As the SLC undergoes on-the-job training and registers its company during the Transformation Stage, it also pools its own resources in order to take out its first loan. These resources, together with the Mentor Investment, are used as collateral for a loan from a local development bank. The matching amount differs based on the bank and its agreement with ISEEK: in India, for example, MUDRA Banks match any Saksham company’s existing capital by four times. The sum of these funds is then dedicated to the business’s start-up expenses.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">Finally, in the Launch and Growth phases, the Mentor Investor advises the SLC in areas like production, quality control, building a line of credit, or other topics for which the entrepreneur has the need and the Investor possesses the expertise. This is achieved through face-to-face mentoring sessions (for local Mentor Investors) and online advisory communications (for all Mentor Investors) via Saksham Management Environment. The start-up mentoring provides SLCs with access to talent that may be essential in discovering its comparative advantage in the market. As the business gains momentum and prepares grow, the Mentor Investor will play a role in strengthening its capacity to seek growth funding from external sources and ensure its sustainability.</p>

                <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="hdm">
                    <p class="text-muted">Saksham’s Hybrid Development Model represents a reimagined implementation design, in which program beneficiaries transform into small businesses through a progression of high and then limited levels of support. Development is accelerated through the participants’ use of advanced technology to facilitate the production of high-end, competitive products. The Hybrid Development Model consists of two high support phases - the Learning phase and the Transformation phase – and two limited support phases, the Launch phase and the Growth phase. In the high support phases, financial support combined with intensive training equips the pre-existing savings and loans groups to start a business. In the limited support stages, Daksh technology is always available to alert experts to intervene proactively in order to ensure the success of the businesses in the local and global marketplace.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">Under Project Saksham, Savings and Loan Communities (SLCs) transform into self-sustaining businesses through the Hybrid Development Model: a short period of high support followed by release into the free market. The Hybrid Development Model represents a reimagined development paradigm that brings work to the people and achieves tremendous impact. By providing extensive knowledge resources, state-of-the-art equipment, and the psychological tools necessary to take the risk of starting and running a business, the Model turns the notion that technology replaces jobs on its head. In this case, technology facilitates the creation of jobs. All of this is achieved at the community level, thereby relieving stress on urban areas and strengthening local economies. Two years from the start of the training process, Saksham entrepreneurs will generate a 10x return on investment in terms of disposable income. This is achieved through high-end technology, resulting in high value-add products.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">The Saksham Hybrid Development Model consists of four stages:<br>
                        (1) The Learning Stage,<br>
                        (2) The Transformation Stage,<br>
                        (3) The Launch Stage, and<br>
                        (4) The Growth Stage.<br>
                        As Saksham utilizes the collective entrepreneurship paradigm, it is assumed that upon preparation for the program, groups of 10 to 12 have formed into Savings and Loan Communities, or a similar structure.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">The first 2-4 months of the Saksham Hybrid Development Model comprise the Learning Stage, the length of which will vary based on baseline skill levels. This stage consists of educating the SLCs on business, health, and vocational skills concepts in the classroom and on Saksham’s information-communication technology (ICT) platform, Daksh. This stage of intensive knowledge growth is bolstered by support from the local government in order to cover costs for training, and one-on-one expertise from local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and vocational specialists. At the end of the learning stage, SLCs are equipped for practical training.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">In the Transformation Stage, skilled and trained SLCs practice their acquired skills through on-the-job training (OJT) in vocational skills appropriate to the region and its resources, and learn to manage their future businesses on the Daksh Learning and Management Environment, then formally register their businesses as small/micro enterprises. During this phase, as the SLC undergoes the transition to a small business, its members are now empowered and better equipped for the infusion of capital into their business, which takes the form of debt (local bank loan), equity (Mentor Investor stake in company), as well as their own contribution. Once the companies generate sustainable revenues in the Start-up Stage, government support and direct training phase out.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">At the Launch Stage, the newly created enterprises are fully operational with limited support. The Saksham program ensures that there is a demand for, at most, 50% of their respective capacities. The “management” (including the mentor) of the firm is responsible for creatively utilizing the remaining 50% of the capacity. The bank is also required to monitor the finances of the business through the Daksh dashboard. Through a network of talent, support is readily available should a company run into a problem or a roadblock.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">During the Growth Stage, the nascent company may take a number of paths: sustain operation as a small business, grow into a larger business organically, or grow exponentially with external investments and decide to “graduate” out of the Saksham sphere. Successful companies, with the help of global investors, become formal enterprises competing in the global markets. Saksham’s technology platform supplies real-time interplay between the new business and sources of capital (e.g. investors), actors in the local/global marketplace (retailers), and business expertise.</p>
