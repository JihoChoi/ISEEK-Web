    <h2>Alok Chaturvedi, Director</h2>
    <p>Alok's interest in social entrepreneurship started in 2005 when he was involved in an international effort to win the hearts and minds of people of Iraq and Afghanistan. During that time he came to the realization that the only way out of poverty and destitution is empowerment through entrepreneurship and knowledge, and not through government and international aid.</p>
  <p>The challenge in war torn and remote regions of the globe is that a vast number of people are illiterate and are left behind while the rest of the world marches on to a better living with the diffusion of the Internet.</p>
  <p>In the last five years as mobile phones and smart devices started to penetrate many remote places, new opportunities are opening up for people living in extreme poverty. To take advantage of the smartphone revolution Alok's vision is to create massively scalable resources that will empower impoverished people from around the globe to identify and achieve their personal, social, and financial goals and raise themselves out of poverty through entrepreneurship.</p>
  <p>Alok, along with several collaborators, is creating comprehensive, contextually and culturally relevant entrepreneurship games and delivering customized curricula using innovative information and communication technologies designed to reach and support those with the least access to education and opportunity.</p>
